1.First,we generated plaintexts.txt by running the code file Generate-inputs.ipynb in jupyter notebook.

2.Then we ran the server.py code file with plaintexts.txt  as input which in return generates ciphertexts.txt file.

3..After that, we have ran the CryptAnalysis.ipynb code file in jupyter notebook.We have got final E vector and A matrix by running this code which is used later while running the decrypt.ipynb code file to get the password.
