1.First,we generated plaintext1.txt and plaintext2.txt by running the code file generate_inputs.ipynb.

2.Then we ran the server1.py code file with plaintext1.txt  as input which in return generates ciphertext1.txt file.Likewise when we ran the server2.py file with plaintext2.txt as input we get ciphertext2.txt file as output.

2.After that, we have ran the CryptAnalysis.ipynb code file which in return generated sbox_in1.txt,sbox_in2.txt,sbox_out1.txt,sbox_out2.txt,exp_out1.txt, exp_out2.txt files.We also get Master Key by running this code which is used later while running the decrypt.cpp code file to get the password.
